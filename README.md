# OOP in Python ‚Äì Assignment for Computer Programming 2

This project contains solutions to 5 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) questions using Python, following the principles of:

- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Class/Instance/Static Methods

## üîß Implemented Tasks

python oop_assignment.py
```

The script will display the output of all tasks in the console.
